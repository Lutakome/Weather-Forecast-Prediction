# Weather-Prediction
The Weather Forecast Dataset consists of 2,500 observations with various weather-related features. This dataset is designed for practicing machine learning, specifically for classification tasks, by predicting the occurrence of rain based on specific weather conditions.

## 📊 Features in the Dataset:
🌡️ Temperature: Temperature recorded in degrees Celsius.

💧 Humidity: Relative humidity measured as a percentage.

💨 Wind Speed: Wind speed measured in km/h.

☁️ Cloud Cover: Percentage of the sky covered by clouds.

🔍 Pressure: Atmospheric pressure measured in hPa (hectopascals).

🌧️ Rain: The target variable for classification, indicating the occurrence of rain. It is a binary variable with two possible values: rain and no rain.

# ⚙️ Key Characteristics:
Balanced Features: The dataset includes a mix of weather parameters that influence rainfall, providing a comprehensive overview of atmospheric conditions.

Class Imbalance: The Rain feature exhibits an imbalance, with a higher number of no rain instances compared to rain. This is an important consideration for model training and evaluation.

Data Types: There are five numerical features (Temperature, Humidity, Wind_Speed, Cloud_Cover, and Pressure) and one categorical feature (Rain).

#🎯 Objective:

The primary goal is to build a classification model that accurately predicts whether it will rain based on the input weather conditions. This involves:
Analyzing relationships between different weather features and rainfall.

Building predictive models using machine learning techniques.

Evaluating model performance to determine which features contribute most to predicting rainfall.

Hypothesis Testing: Conduct hypothesis testing to understand whether specific features such as Humidity, Cloud Cover, Temperature, Pressure, and Wind Speed have a statistically significant impact on the occurrence of rain.
